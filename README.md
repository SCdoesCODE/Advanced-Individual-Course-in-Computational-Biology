# Advanced Individual Course in Computational Biology

This repository contains the code written for my Computational Biology project focused on Viral Escape. 

I chose this electrive course to challenge myself, learn how to carry out a larger machine learning project on my own as well as how to convey the results in a scientific and pedagogic way. I am also fascinated by the great potential for machine learning in areas like medicine and the environment and thought it would be interesting to work on an individual computational biology project. I had a supervisor (Erik Frans√©n, Professor at KTH) who would continuously provide me with very valuable feedback on my work and I have gained a lot of useful experience from taking this course.
